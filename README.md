## Games 

### Human Power
Made in under 48 hours for Kenny's Game Jam 2025
https://itch.io/jam/kenney-jam-2025

The theme was "Power", only allowed to use Kenny or KayKit assets for the game. (excluding sound & fonts).
This was the first game I made using the "engine", and it was definitely a fun challenge and great learning experience.
